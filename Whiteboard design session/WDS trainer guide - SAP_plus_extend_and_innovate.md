## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

- Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

- Become familiar with all key points and activities.

- Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

- Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

- Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

- **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

- **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

- **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants**. Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

# SAP plus extend and innovate student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives

Contoso Retail, Inc. has been facing challenges in modernizing its on-premises SAP landscape in order to better compete in the current marketplace. Among the main challenges are that Contoso has an aging on-premises infrastructure, not capable of running more demanding analytical workloads.  They do not have a disaster recovery environment and limited high-availability provisions. Contoso has found that it is expensive to maintain development and testing environments. They have a lack of full visibility of supply and demand signals across the value chain.  They are also insufficient in their ability to use customer data, precluding the ability to implement targeted advertising. They have determined that they maintain a suboptimal delivery route planning and scheduling.

As a struggling retailer, Contoso has been dealing with significant financial constraints. Given a hard limit of its capital expenditure budget, Contoso has been considering leveraging its operational budget and taking advantage of the pay-as-you-go model offered by Microsoft Azure. 

To remedy these challenges, Contoso has asked you to design and implement a solution that will help them regain the competitive edge by transitioning their SAP landscape to Azure and modernizing it by leveraging Azure services. 

Contoso has determined that to optimize their environment, the following key success criteria must be met.  They would like a highly available SAP landscape with the ability to minimize cost through right-sizing and optimized resource allocation.  They need data integration and analytics capabilities that include the ability to provide a comprehensive view of logistical and operational data, including sensor data from IoT devices in warehouses, stores, and manufacturing plants.  Contoso would like to utilize social media sentiment analytics and personalized marketing.  In addition, they would like to improve delivery route planning and scheduling, leveraging external data feeds that account for such factors as road closures or inclement weather.  They also would like optimized demand forecasting with automatic anomaly detection within their supply chain.

Your primary objective is to provide integration across all data to be used for analysis and reporting, bringing together manufacturing, supply chain, and sales. Your solution should help the customer, represented by the Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Digital Officer, the Chief Data Officer, and the Customer Experience Manager, deliver a 360-degree view of the Contoso's business operations and to optimize them through data analytics. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and Chief Informtion Officer (CIO) believe that providing this level of customer insights will increase revenue and deliver a competitive advantage to Contoso.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study 

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions:  With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1.  Meet your team members and trainer.

2.  Read all directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3.  As a team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Contoso Retail, Inc. has been selling goods through various retail channels for the past 15 years. They currently have over 200 brick-and-mortar stores but plan to reduce the number of physical locations to 150 in the next year due to declining revenue and various other factors. Of the remaining 150 stores, 35 of them are currently streamlined for an attempted re-branding that happened a few years ago. 

SAP is the line-of-business application and database for all customer and supply chain information. SAP will manage the customer experience, including finance, inventory, delivery, and customer service.  SAP will be used to integrate with suppliers for re-ordering of products based on demand and sales projections. Sales and Inventory data will be delivered to executives for revenue projections for analysis of trends and potential shifts in demand.

Contoso needs the ability to collect and analyze data from within SAP in order to make the best uniform solution possible. They want to take control of their supply chain, so customers know when and where products are available, and stores are prepared to keep up with demand.

The improved ability to meet customer demand will be accomplished by establishing a 360-degree view of the supply chain. With data analysis and reporting, stores will be able to plan and schedule product deliveries based on customer sentiment and current buying trends. 

Contoso has brought together a group of SAP, Azure, Applications, and Data and AI specialists to design and architect a solution that meets the company's needs. To remediate these shortcomings, Contoso is looking for the ability to combine all sources of data, including:

*   Contoso has sensor data from IoT devices in warehouses, stores, and manufacturing plants they would like to be able to analyze.
*   They would like to utilize social media sentiment analytics for inventory recommendations.
*   Contoso would like to use external feeds with such information as road closures and inclement weather to manage deliveries efficiently.

Contoso wants to take control of their supply chain to ensure that their customers can easily locate and purchase the products they are interested in and that their stores are prepared to keep up with the actual demand. To accomplish this, Contoso will need to establish a 360-degree view of the supply chain, with data analysis and reporting that provides the business with the ability to address manufacturing and service issues, plan, and schedule deliveries of products according to forecasted needs, and gauge these needs based on customer sentiment and up-to-date buying trends.

As part of its business plan, Contoso is looking to implement the following objectives:

*   They would like to provision compute and storage resources which capacity exceeds what's currently supported by the aging on-premises infrastructure hosting the existing SAP landscape.  
*   Contoso has invested in SAP S/4HANA for all ERP, finance, customer experience and CRM, and supply chain management solutions.
*   Contoso wants to increase resiliency by including full-fledged high-availability provisions and setting up a disaster recovery site.
*   They want to minimize cost of development and testing environments.
*   Whenever possible, Contoso would like to simplify the operational model by leveraging managed services.
*   Contoso would like to enhance delivery route planning and scheduling by referencing external data feeds that account for such factors as road closures or inclement weather.
*   They would like to integrate the SAP-resident data with disparate data sources, including Twitter feeds and IoT devices.
*   Contoso wants to automate collection, pre-processing, and analytics of streaming data.
*   They would like to consolidate online and in-store data to facilitate targeted advertising tailored towards individual customers.
*   Contoso wants to improve online customer experience by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as natural language understanding.

### Customer needs

1.  Contoso wants to minimize the cost by right sizing the SAP landscape implementation and optimize the use of compute resources.

2. They would like to leverage Azure services to extend and innovate data collection and analysis (including sensor data from IoT devices, web site and app telemetry, as well as social networking feeds reflecting customer behavior, sentiment, and purchasing patterns).

3. Contoso would like to fine-tune inventory and staff management to ensure all channels are working with the optimal resource allocation according to predicted demands.

4. Contoso wants to streamline remediation of manufacturing service issues and enhance available-to-promise retail capabilities.

5. They would also like to minimize the operational overhead within their current processes.

### Customer objections

1.  We currently have all the data we need, why do we need to do anything else?

2.  We've spent a lot of money and time building out the systems we have, why should we start over in Azure rather than upgrade our existing hardware?

3.  How will this solution help us to create a better process for getting our products from the manufacturing to the warehouses and then to the stores any quicker? Our staff is already working overtime and trucks won't be able to physically drive any faster while maintaining safety standards. 

4.  How can we ensure the privacy of our customers is sufficiently protected if we pursue targeted advertising by leveraging Azure services?

### Infographic for common scenarios

SAP on Azure provides many potential scenarios and benefits that are shown in this illustration.

## Preferred solution  

_High-level architecture_

The proposed solutions take advantage of a wide range of Azure services in order to enhance the agility, resiliency, and resiliency of the customer's SAP landscape, as well as to deliver additional data integration capabilities. In particular, it provides the following functionality:

- Support for in-region and cross-region redundancy, providing high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.
- A development and test environment, where costs can be minimized through an optimal resource sizing and snoozing.
- Hot and cold paths for ingesting, processing, and storing data generated by IoT devices, implemented by using Azure IoT Intelligent Edge.
- Hot and cold paths for ingesting, processing, and storing data generated by social media, implemented by a range of native Azure services.
- Integration with Azure Machine Learning and Azure Cognitive Services.
- Business integration that leverages Azure Logic Apps.

  ![This is a diagram illustrating the preferred solution for extending data and AI into an SAP architecture.](media/azure-data-pipeline-social-media.png 'Diagram of the Preferred solution') 

_Data ingestion and integration_

1. Which Azure services can you use to ingest data from sources such as IoT devices and social networking feeds?
    
    Azure IoT Intelligent Edge a combination of Azure services and a runtime that runs on IoT devices. The runtime manages containerized modules that you can use to implement business logic in the form of SAP and in-house developed applications. The modules extend the application functionality to the edge of your enterprise, expediting a response to IoT device-generated events by applying relevant actions directly to the source. 
    
    In addition, the modules handle bulk of processing tasks at the edge, limiting the dependency on the cloud compute and storage resources, lowering the corresponding cost. By running SAP Essential Business Functions modules on Azure IoT Edge, Contoso will be able to extend the reach of their S4/HANA and C4/HANA workloads directly to their assets, bringing the capabilities of business applications and governance to the edge.

2. Of the options you identified in the previous step, which ones would you recommend to Contoso?
     
    IoT Edge consists of the following components:

    - Azure IoT Hub, which provides a cloud-hosted backend to connect IoT devices with Azure cloud services. IoT Hub enables highly secure and reliable bi-directional communication, management, and provisioning (by using Device Provisioning Service, aka DPS) for IoT Edge devices.
    - Azure Storage provides flexible, scalable, secure, and inexpensive data stores. The solution can use Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake to store massive amounts of unstructured data.
    - Azure Cognitive Services are a family of AI services and cognitive APIs that help build intelligent apps. For example, the solution could provide image recognition by leveraging Computer Vision and Custom Vision services.
    - Machine Learning (ML) uses algorithms to automatically improve predictions or decisions through a self-learning process. Machine learning algorithms help ensure that the modules deployed to IoT devices remain accurate despite changing data trends.

      Azure IoT Hub serves as an ingestion point for sensor-generated data. IoT Hub is a managed service that acts as a central message hub for bidirectional communications between IoT applications and IoT devices. It scales to millions of devices, reliably and securely connecting them to their backend solutions. With the IoT Hub's capabilities, you can build IoT solutions that manage equipment used in manufacturing and monitor retail inventory levels.

    ![Diagram illustrating an Azure data pipeline that leverages Azure IoT intelligent edge.](media/azure-data-pipeline-iot-intelligent-edge.png 'Azure data pipeline that leverages IoT Intelligent Edge') 

3. What data integration options would Contoso benefit from?
   
    In addition, business, and customer data from sources such as social media postings, third party applications, and external sites can be ingested by using services such as Event Hub, parsed by Stream Analytics, aggregated into Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake, and, subsequently, processed and analyzed by Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure HDInsight, or Azure Data Lake Analytics. At various points of the data path, you have the option to leverage Cognitive Services and Azure Machine Learning models to offer even deeper understanding of what customers might be interested in, based on such criteria as consumer sentiment or social media trending.

    For integration purposes, you can take advantage of Azure Logic Apps or use Azure Data Factory as part of pipeline for social media feeds, transferring and manipulating data between Azure Blob Storage, Data Lake Store, or delivering it directly to SAP HANA. 

    Azure Logic Apps simplify authoring and implementation of trigger-driven integration workflows that leverage a visual designer and 250+ connectors, including a bi-directional connector for SAP. The connector is compatible with:

    - On-premises and cloud-based HANA-based SAP systems, such as S/4 HANA.
    - Classic on-premises SAP systems, such as R/3 and ECC.

    The SAP connector supports integration between non-SAP application and SAP systems through Intermediate Document (IDoc), Business Application Programming Interface (BAPI), or Remote Function Call (RFC). For example, you can create a relatively simple Logic App that reads tweets, analyses their text by employing Cognitive Services' Sentiment Analysis, and uses the SAP connector to store the outcome in a HANA database. Logic Apps can also provide conditional workflow management, passing messages to appropriate downstream targets, such as a call handler, notification hub, or email, a tweet, or a chatbot. 

    ![Diagram illustrating an Azure data pipeline that leverages social media.](media/azure-data-pipeline-social-media.png 'Azure data pipeline that leverages social media') 

4. Which Azure integration services would you recommend be used by Contoso?
  
   Alternatively, it is possible to build low-code apps and workflows by using Microsoft Power Platform that includes SAP ERP connector for Power Apps and Power Automate, which provides the equivalent functionality. The connector is certified by SAP for integration with SAP S/4HANA and SAP ERP and allows integration with SAP ERP systems via BAPIs and RFCs, including support for dynamic schemas.

    ![Diagram illustrating a Power Platform flow that includes a SAP ERP connector.](media/power-platform-sap-erp-connector.png 'Power Platform SAP ERP connector') 

_Data transformation and processing_

1. How would you approach the need for additional analysis of data originating from SAP and non-SAP data sources?
   
   You have the option of combining SAP and non-SAP data sources for additional transformation and processing. This might involve long-running batch jobs to filter, aggregate, and prepare data for further analysis. Processing options include U-SQL jobs in Azure Data Lake Analytics, Hive, Pig, and custom Map/Reduce jobs in an HDInsight cluster, or Java, Scala, and Python programs in a Synapse Analytics Spark cluster. 
   
2. Which Azure services would you use to implement the corresponding functionality?
      
   It is also possible to use Azure Data Factory to extract data from SAP HANA and SAP Business Warehouse (BW) into Azure data stores, such as Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake to facilitate implementation of advanced analytics with Azure Synapse Analytics. 

    ![Diagram illustrating an Azure data pipeline that leverages SAP and non-SAP data sources.](media/azure-data-pipeline-with-sap-sources.png 'Azure data pipeline that leverages the preferred solution') 

_Data analytics_

1. How would you analyze the data to facilitate identifying relevant information?
   
   The solution prepares data for analysis and then serves the processed data in a structured format that can be queried using analytical tools. The analytical data store used to serve these queries can be a relational data warehouse, which is part of the existing business intelligence solution. Alternatively, the data could be presented through a low-latency NoSQL technology such as HBase, or an interactive Hive database that provides a metadata abstraction over data files in the distributed data store. 

    Azure Synapse Analytics provides a managed service for large-scale, cloud-based data warehousing. Azure Synapse Analytics Spark tools are optimized for analyzing and transforming data for presentation. This analysis could reference data stored in Azure Cosmos DB. For example, Azure Synapse Link for Azure Cosmos DB enables you to run near real-time analytics over operational data in Azure Cosmos DB. 

2. What Azure services would allow Contoso to further enrich the data by leveraging technologies such as artificial intelligence?

      To further enrich your data, you can combine data from your SAP databases with other systems pooled into Azure Data Lake. With Azure Synapse Analytics and Power BI dashboards, you are able to monitor supplier status, track inbound materials flows, and oversee logistics in real time. This also allows you to overlay operating status with external data such as road closures or inclement weather to identify potential problems before they might impact production schedules or customer deliveries. Combining market and demand data with your resource planning systems, you can further improve
      business forecasting.

      Another option that helps your further innovate the way you manage business data is Azure Anomaly Detector, which is part of Azure Cognitive Services. Anomaly Detector allows you to evaluate transactions, represented by time series data, across your entire SAP landscape in order to detect potential issues before they might have a negative impact. Based on incoming telemetry sources, the Anomaly Detector solution detects if there is a sudden change in creation or update processes. The detection algorithm can detect these issues automatically, in real time, and notify you in order to initiate a corrective action.

      For example, Contoso could use Anomaly Detector to monitor changes to the Master Data Management (MDM) space, hosting objects representing business entities such as customers and business partners to detect and, optionally, remediate any unusual patterns. Similarly, Contoso could leverage Anomaly Detector to detect a sudden increase in online purchases of a particular product on its e‑commerce website. This would allow them to take immediate actions to ensure product availability. 

      Contoso could implement Anomaly Detector with native Azure services composing decoupled business logic and the presentation layers. These services include: 

      - An Azure web app, which forms the presentation layer. Its purpose is to allow users to call the anomaly-detection service by using the prepared time-series data. The choice of Azure Web App Service gives Contoso's developers the option to work in their preferred language, including .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. In addition, the application endpoint can be protected by leveraging Azure Active Directory for authentication and authorization.
      - Two Azure function apps, which host all business-logic functionality. The first is used to connect to Azure Application Insights and capture SAP telemetry, such as customer or business-partner processes that are target of anomaly detection. This function app transforms target data into JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format with time-series sub formatting. The second function app captures the precompiled time-series data from the first function app, makes a call to the Anomaly Detector service, and then retrieves the result. At that point, the web app presentation layer displays the results in a graph format. 
      - Application Insights, which stores all SAP log data. This log data is captured from various business processes, including Customer Master Data creation, Business Partner Creation and updates, and batch program logs. These logs serve as the source for anomaly detection.
      - Azure Anomaly Detector, which exposes API to detect and returns all anomaly points based on time-series data sent by the function app. It is possible to interact with Anomaly Detector either by directly using the HTTP REST API or by relying on client SDK.

### Customer Needs

1. Contoso wants to minimize the cost by right sizing the SAP landscape implementation and optimize the use of compute resources.

    The proposed solutions take advantage of the hyper-scale and agility offered by Azure in order to optimize efficiency and minimize cost of implementing and maintaining the customer's SAP landscape. Azure is SAP certified to run your mission-critical SAP applications. It offers is the industry's most performant and scalable SAP cloud infrastructure, including 25+ configurations that span virtual machines and purpose-built bare metal instances with memory ranging from 192GB to 24TB, in more regions than any other public cloud provider. Its capabilities extend beyond production workloads, expediting setup of a development and test environment, which cost can be minimized through resource proper sizing and snoozing.

    A Forrester study published in 2019 found that organizations which migrate SAP to Azure can expect more than a 100% return on investment within 3 years. According to the same study, by the second year, organizations will typically be able to reduce staff required to manage SAP infrastructure by 50% and accelerate SAP releases by 100% due to the ability to rapidly provision test environments. Effectively, organizations can accelerate development cycles, run test marketing campaigns, and validate new product opportunities much faster, greatly reducing time to market. Similarly, financial, and human resources previously dedicated to IT overhead can be allocated to pursuing product and business innovation and new market growth initiatives.


2. They would like to leverage Azure services to extend and innovate data collection and analysis (including sensor data from IoT devices, web site and app telemetry, as well as social networking feeds reflecting customer behavior, sentiment, and purchasing patterns).

    The proposed solutions take advantage of a wide range of Azure services in order to enhance data integration capabilities. In particular, it provides the following functionality:

   - Hot and cold paths for ingesting, processing, and storing data generated by IoT devices, implemented by using Azure IoT Intelligent Edge.
   - Hot and cold paths for ingesting, processing, and storing data generated by social media, implemented by a range of native Azure services.

    By combining and correlating data from multiple sources, such as social network postings, reviews from external web sites, and physical sensor data from retail outlets, Contoso will be able to gain deeper understanding of what their customers want and deliver fine-tuned and timely response. 


3. Contoso would like to fine-tune inventory and staff management to ensure all channels are working with the optimal resource allocation according to predicted demands.

    The proposed solution expands the scope of the collected data, facilitating data enrichment, including the ability to combine data from your SAP databases with other systems pooled into Azure Data Lake. With Azure Synapse Analytics and Power BI dashboards, Contoso will have full visibility into supplier status, inbound materials flows, and logistics in real time. This will facilitate correlating operating status with external data such as road closures or inclement weather to identify potential problems before they might impact production schedules or customer deliveries. By combining market and demand data with resource planning systems, Contoso will be able to further improve its business forecasting.


4. Contoso wants to streamline remediation of manufacturing service issues and enhance available-to-promise retail capabilities.

    The proposed solution incorporates IoT sensor data from manufacturing plants and retail outlets. Assets from these connected environments support bidirectional communication, allowing them to communicate their status as well as receive direct inputs, resulting in maximized efficiency and minimized operational overhead. Device signals can report on equipment health and maintenance needs or help identify efficiency problems either at the individual machine level or in the interactions between machines over an end-to-end production workflow.

    Similarly, smart sensors powered by Azure IoT Edge can detect the movement of physical products within warehouses or stores and automatically trigger restocking processes. Real time inventory fluctuations can be processed by Azure Stream Analytics and fed into SAP Forecasting and Replenishment to automate and accelerate the supply chain cycle.

5. They would also like to minimize the operational overhead within their current processes.

    The solution will help Contoso accomplish this objective by improving operational efficiency. This means having trucks that are fully loaded with the correct products and warehouses that are staffed with the personnel best equipped to handle the task at hand. Contoso will use for this purpose predictive analytics that take into account historical data and combine it with Azure AI and ML services to derive the most likely future outcome.

### Checklist of preferred objection handling

1.  We currently have all the data we need, why do we need to do anything else?

    The traditional approach to data integration is no longer sufficient in the modern marketplace. Retailers can now derive meaningful benefits from end-to-end visibility of supply and demand signals across the value chain. This starts at a store aisle, where smart sensors powered by Azure IoT Edge can detect movement of physical products on shelves and automatically trigger restocking processes. Real time inventory fluctuations can be processed by Azure Stream Analytics and fed into the SAP Forecasting and Replenishment (SAP F&R) solution to automate and accelerate the supply chain cycle. In parallel, retailers could leverage external data that represents external conditions in order to evaluate how they may affect local demand patterns. The ability to account for external data such as breaking news, weather, or sporting events can help detect and align to shifts in customer demand within hours. Predictive intelligence provided by Microsoft and SAP analytics tools, AI and machine learning models facilitate implementing such solutions, resulting in optimized procurement cycles, minimizing waste, and maximizing profits.

    Similarly, companies can use Azure analytics and Power BI dashboards to monitor supplier status, inbound materials flows and logistics in real time. Through Azure, they can overlay operating status with external data such as road closures or inclement weather to predict problems before they can impact production schedules or customer deliveries. 

    By combining SAP- and Azure-based analytics, it becomes easier to uncover sales trends and customer preferences, resulting in optimized production targets and increased revenues. By expediting planning cycles in coordination with supplier networks and logistics providers, retailers can get products to market faster and deliver tailored products at scale. 

    In addition, retailers can leverage new sources of customer and market data such as social network postings or review sites from outside the organization. This provides even deeper understanding of customers buying patterns and helps track their changes in real time. Such data can be ingested, aggregated, and analyzed by leveraging Azure AI and ML models to predict what offers and experiences will have the most significant impact. At the same time, availability of such data helps build highly accurate and granular profiles for each customer to understand their unique interests and buying patterns. This, in turn, makes it more likely to be able to effectively capture customers' attention, improving their satisfaction and the likelihood of making an actual purchase. 

    Similarly, in the manufacturing scenarios, companies like Contoso will benefit from transitioning to the connected factory paradigm. Modern systems that carry out manufacturing tasks are equipped with smart sensors and controls that directly integrate them with the Internet-connected world. These connected assets can communicate their status as well as receive and process digital input, offering new ways to monitor and automate production lines. Device signals can report equipment health and maintenance needs or help identify efficiency problems either at the individual machine level or in the interactions between machines over an end-to-end production workflow. By incorporating this operational data with existing IT systems and line-of-business applications, manufacturers gain an integrated view of the production landscape and fine-grained control over the physical processes that determine factory performance.

    Sensor-equipped smart machines considerably simplify predictive maintenance and servicing, which minimize operational failures and the corresponding lost productivity. They also provide manufacturers with the ability to track real-time status of their environment, which helps detect anomalous behavior patterns. Tools such as Microsoft Power BI help create operator dashboards that automatically refresh at scheduled intervals, delivering an easy-to-analyze overview of up-to-date utilization and efficiency levels. 

    Combining business data with device telemetry and operational data can significantly increase production efficiency and flexibility, providing an integrated view of operations and improving control over physical production processes. Azure AI and ML solutions help build autonomous workflows that reduce human intervention while improving quality and performance.

2.  We've spent a lot of money and time building out the systems we have, why should we start over in Azure rather than upgrade our existing hardware?

    While it is possible to leverage Azure services in hybrid scenarios with your on-premises SAP landscape, by migrating it to Azure you will be able to fully realize the benefits that the cloud environment has to offer. These benefits go beyond increased agility, resiliency, and scalability, resulting also in meaningful cost savings. A Forrester study published in 2019 found that organizations which migrate SAP to Azure can expect more than a 100% return on investment within 3 years. According to the same study, by the second year, organizations will typically be able to reduce staff required to manage SAP infrastructure by 50% and accelerate SAP releases by 100% due to the ability to rapidly provision test environments. Effectively, organizations can accelerate development cycles, run test marketing campaigns, and validate new product opportunities much faster, greatly reducing time to market. Similarly, financial, and human resources previously dedicated to IT overhead can be allocated to pursuing product and business innovation and new market growth initiatives.
